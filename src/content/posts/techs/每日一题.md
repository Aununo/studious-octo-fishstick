**Problem.** Let $A, B \in M_n(k)$ such that $A^2+B^2=2AB$. Show that

I. det $A$ = det $B$,

II. $A, B$ have the same characteristic polynomials.

*Solution.*

[Matrices A,B satisfying A^2 + B^2 = 2AB have the same characteristic polynomials](https://ysharifi.wordpress.com/2022/08/21/matrices-ab-satisfying-a2-b2-2ab-have-the-same-characteristic-polynomials/)
