Runzhuo Gan, a boy, resides in Chengdu.

He has no plans for marriage or children

and maintains a stable relationship with his girlfriend.

He was born in 2005.

Wandering aimlessly or daydreaming is his favorite pastime.

Although he has scars on his body that are about 14 years younger than him,

a doctor once remarked that now his pulse is as steady as his mind.

He is currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering with UESTC.

His interests are very broad, with a specialization in deep learning and applied cryptography.

He feels fortunate enough to live fervently in this world.
